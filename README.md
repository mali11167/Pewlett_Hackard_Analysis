# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
# Overview
In this project we are using SQL to analyze data and write queries to retrieve data for company named Pewlett Hackard. The company needs data for employees
that are eligible for retirement. Based on that data they want to offer employees mentorship program as many employees leaving the company at the same time would
leave a great void that would be need to be filled. The mentorship program will help assist new employees into their new job roles with the help of experienced 
employees by their side.
# Results
We had a lot of data to analyze as there was information of all the employees over the years and those employees switched roles during their time period at the company. 
As some got promotions, some switched to different departments. We had data in the form of csv files and with the help of SQL we were able to get data from different tables
into one table.Our first requirement was to get all the eomployees eligible for retirement and our findings in that was:
* No of senior engineers retiring were 29414.
* No. of Senior staff retiring were 28254.
* No. of Engineers retiring were 14222.
* No. of Staff retiring were 12243.
* No. of Technique leader retiring were 4502
* No. of Assistant engineer retiring were 1761.
* No. of Managers retiring were 2.

Instead of having a large chunk of their workforce retiring, the compnay want to introduce a mentoring program, experienced and successful employees stepping back 
into a part-time role instead of retiring completely. Their new role in the company would be as a mentor to the newly hired folks. Before we pass on this idea we need 
to see how many people between the departments they can offer this program too. We filtered the data according to title, from and to date, birth date and it gave us a 
list of employees who would fall into the criteria. 
# Summary
We see that alot of employees are eligible for retirement. The mentorship program will help with transferral of critical business knowledge and skills, mentoring helps 
to develop a pipeline of future leaders who understand the skills and attitudes required to succeed within the company.
With advantages comes disadvantages also as mentors may lack people skills, mismatch of personality types, bad mentors may do more harm than good or some responsibility 
is taken away. 
To prepare for the silver tsunami we need to see how many positions needs to be filled. We have alot of senior engineers retiring and the mentorship program will be very 
beneficial in this category as you always need good senior engineers in a company.
To fill the void it would be best not to have people retire or mentor until the positions are filled as it will be beneficial for the company and for the employees.
Clerical staff level jobs will not have that big impact as position is not a critical one. 
I think there is enough qualified senior employees ready to be enrolled in mentorship program.
